We request all the attendees to arrive a little early to beat the traffic (since it is weekday - Friday). Also, you definitely won't miss a chance to click snaps with Douglas. We have 2 wonderful live-coding/workshop sessions lined-up post lunch. The details of which is where will be announced on the day of the conference. The last session of the day is Lightning/Flash Talks. We will have a box at the registration counter for you to drop your topics.

It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity.

Functional programming is a great way of doing flow based programming, and fortunately javascript has good support for functional programming. Functional Reactive programming is an old paradigm which has recently started catching developer attention, which allow making most of the complex asynchronous tasks declarative and really simple.

In this workshop we'll learn how to leverage WebGL directly, and also how to utilise it through one of it's most useful abstraction layers: ThreeJS. We'll cover the basics of rendering scenes and objects with lighting, textures and cameras; as well as interacting with them using directly and indirectly through the use of physics engines.
                          //-   | You should come away from this talk with a thirst to learn more about this powerful technology, as well as a basic foundation of skills and knowledge to assist you in that exploration in building your own applications and games.

                          //-   | The new direction Angular 2.0 is taking created a lot of discussion in the community. Some people love it, some people hate it. Most people agree there is room for simplification, performance enhancements and native support of new language features. Not everyone likes the way Angular 2.0 is picking these up though. There is an alternative direction: Aurelia. In this talk, we'll do a side-by-side comparison and have the audience answer the question: Should you keep all your eggs in the Angular basket?

As a developer it is important to be aware of these evolutionary aspects which have led to the current feature set of JS and its Frameworks. More over JS has a very interesting history.

                          //-   | Whatever other tools you use and love, one thing about ReactJS is certain: the 'Virtual DOM' approach is the future of the web. It's just too fast and too sensible to ignore. In this session, we'll learn:
                          //-   ul
                          //-     li What 'Virtual DOM' is and why it matters
                          //-     li How you can begin making use of it now, in your existing environments
                          //-     li
                          //-       | How React also thinks differently about data-binding, with its "one-way reactive data flow"
                          //-   |                         Longer-Term, React combined with the 'Flux' pattern points the way to a very different style of front-end application development than we're used to now: very modular, 'component'-driven architectures. At the same time, one of the signal traits of React/Flux is that more and more of the application is contained exclusively in Javascript files: React's HTML elements are declared as either "JSX" templates, or just as Javascript objects. And some folks are taking this on to the next level, even programming all of their CSS in JS as well! Before this session is over, you'll see how all these pieces fit together and how you can build some very effective, very fast, and very maintainable components and apps this way. That said, we'll also discuss what's still missing from the React/Flux ecosystem, and provide you with a roadmap that allows you decide when you can - and when you can't - build your whole application around it.
