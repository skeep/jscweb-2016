We request all the attendees to arrive a little early to beat the traffic (since it is weekday - Friday). Also, you definitely won't miss a chance to click snaps with Douglas. We have 2 wonderful live-coding/workshop sessions lined-up post lunch. The details of which is where will be announced on the day of the conference. The last session of the day is Lightning/Flash Talks. We will have a box at the registration counter for you to drop your topics.

In this workshop we'll learn how to leverage WebGL directly, and also how to utilise it through one of it's most useful abstraction layers: ThreeJS. We'll cover the basics of rendering scenes and objects with lighting, textures and cameras; as well as interacting with them using directly and indirectly through the use of physics engines.
                          //-   | You should come away from this talk with a thirst to learn more about this powerful technology, as well as a basic foundation of skills and knowledge to assist you in that exploration in building your own applications and games.
                          //-   | In order to take the most from this talk, you should have a good understanding of browser JavaScript API's (the DOM API et al) as well as the heart not to be discouraged when we occasionally use phrases like 'matrix manipulation' and 'vector transforms'.

Most people agree there is room for simplification, performance enhancements and native support of new language features. Not everyone likes the way Angular 2.0 is picking these up though. There is an alternative direction: Aurelia. In this talk, we'll do a side-by-side comparison and have the audience answer the question: Should you keep all your eggs in the Angular basket?

This talk will be about explaining webpack philosophy, and deconstructing simple to complex bundling configurations. I will also touch upon webpack 2 and the new features it brings.

                          //-   | Whatever other tools you use and love, one thing about ReactJS is certain: the 'Virtual DOM' approach is the future of the web. It's just too fast and too sensible to ignore. In this session, we'll learn:
                          //-   ul
                          //-     li What 'Virtual DOM' is and why it matters
                          //-     li How you can begin making use of it now, in your existing environments
                          //-     li
                          //-       | How React also thinks differently about data-binding, with its "one-way reactive data flow"
                          //-   |                         Longer-Term, React combined with the 'Flux' pattern points the way to a very different style of front-end application development than we're used to now: very modular, 'component'-driven architectures. At the same time, one of the signal traits of React/Flux is that more and more of the application is contained exclusively in Javascript files: React's HTML elements are declared as either "JSX" templates, or just as Javascript objects. And some folks are taking this on to the next level, even programming all of their CSS in JS as well! Before this session is over, you'll see how all these pieces fit together and how you can build some very effective, very fast, and very maintainable components and apps this way. That said, we'll also discuss what's still missing from the React/Flux ecosystem, and provide you with a roadmap that allows you decide when you can - and when you can't - build your whole application around it.

                            span.p2 In this workshop we'll build a React app using Redux architecture. For a twist, we'll use ES7 Observable (via RxJS@5) for an arguably better, but definitely different flow of control in our app. React is the boat, redux is the oar, and we will sail in the waters of reactive programming with ES7 Observable. We'll see where React falls short in its "reactive" approach, we'll fill up the holes in Redux architectuer, and we'll tangentially touch an overall alternate approach to architect our apps without frameworks ('tangentially' being the keyword here.)
